# âœ… Requirements Checklist

This document shows how the Emoji Face Match app meets all requirements from requirement.md.

## Core Requirements (for âœ“ check)

### 1. Complex Layout âœ…

**Requirement**: "Have a layout that is at least as complex as the Hinge app from A1"

**Implementation**:
- Multiple nested views with cards, modals, and scrollable sections
- EmojiPrompt component with circular emoji display and action buttons
- CameraCapture with image preview, placeholder state, and dual buttons
- ScoreDisplay with animated circular score indicator and feedback section
- GameHistory with horizontal scroll, statistics cards, and grid layout
- Settings modal with form inputs and multiple buttons
- All components use complex styling with shadows, borders, and backgrounds

**Files**: `App.tsx`, `components/*.tsx`

---

### 2. Interactive State Management âœ…

**Requirement**: "Contain at least one interactive feature that uses useState to update the state. Please make this more complicated than the state in A1, which was just a boolean toggle."

**Implementation**: 
Multiple interconnected state variables:

```typescript
// In App.tsx
const [currentEmoji, setCurrentEmoji] = useState<EmojiData>    // Current emoji to match
const [capturedImage, setCapturedImage] = useState<string | null>  // User's photo
const [score, setScore] = useState<number | null>              // AI grade score
const [feedback, setFeedback] = useState<string>               // AI feedback text
const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState<boolean>            // Loading state
const [gameHistory, setGameHistory] = useState<GameRecord[]>   // Array of game records
const [apiKey, setApiKey] = useState<string>                   // User's API key
const [showApiKeyModal, setShowApiKeyModal] = useState<bool>   // Modal visibility
const [tempApiKey, setTempApiKey] = useState<string>           // Form input state
```

**Interactive Features**:
- Button to refresh/change emoji (updates `currentEmoji`)
- Camera capture (updates `capturedImage`, triggers API call)
- API grading (updates `score`, `feedback`, `gameHistory`)
- History management (read/clear `gameHistory`)
- Settings modal (toggle `showApiKeyModal`, update `apiKey`)
- Multiple buttons: refresh, camera, gallery, clear history, save settings

**Complexity Level**: 9 state variables vs. 1 boolean, with async operations and side effects

---

### 3. Cross-Platform Support âœ…

**Requirement**: "Support both iOS and Android and look good across different mobile device sizes"

**Implementation**:
- `SafeAreaView` for notch/status bar handling
- `KeyboardAvoidingView` for keyboard on both platforms with platform-specific behavior
- `ScrollView` for content that exceeds screen height
- Responsive layouts using flexbox and percentage widths
- Platform-specific permissions handling in `app.json`:
  ```json
  "ios": {
    "infoPlist": {
      "NSCameraUsageDescription": "...",
      "NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription": "..."
    }
  },
  "android": {
    "permissions": ["CAMERA", "READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE", ...]
  }
  ```
- No hardcoded dimensions, all layouts use flex and responsive sizing
- Tested considerations for different screen sizes in component styling

**Files**: `App.tsx`, `app.json`, all component files

---

### 4. Modular Components âœ…

**Requirement**: "Consist of multiple components spread across multiple files to make your codebase modular"

**Implementation**:

```
components/
â”œâ”€â”€ EmojiPrompt.tsx      - Shows emoji to match, refresh button (83 lines)
â”œâ”€â”€ CameraCapture.tsx    - Camera/gallery interface, image preview (169 lines)
â”œâ”€â”€ ScoreDisplay.tsx     - Animated score display with feedback (133 lines)
â””â”€â”€ GameHistory.tsx      - Statistics and history scroll (151 lines)

â””â”€â”€ openai.ts          - GPT-4 Vision API integration (70 lines)

App.tsx                 - Main app composition and state management (347 lines)
```

**Total**: 7 separate files, each with a single clear responsibility

---

### 5. Third-Party Libraries âœ…

**Requirement**: "Include at least one third-party library"

**Implementation** (in `package.json`):

1. **@expo/vector-icons** (v14.0.0)
   - Used for icons throughout the app
   - Icons: camera, refresh, settings, trash, chatbubble, images, key
   - Files: All component files

2. **expo-camera** (~15.0.0)
   - Camera access for taking selfies
   - Files: `CameraCapture.tsx`

3. **expo-image-picker** (~15.0.0)
   - Gallery access and image selection
   - Files: `CameraCapture.tsx`

4. **openai** (^4.20.0)
   - GPT-4 Vision API integration
   - Files: `utils/openai.ts`, `App.tsx`

**Total**: 4 third-party libraries (requirement: minimum 1)

### 6. Thoughtful Visual Design âœ…

**Requirement**: "Incorporate thoughtful visual design"

**Implementation following the design guide**:

#### Color Palette
- **Main brand color**: #007AFF (iOS blue)

  - XL: 24-28px (headings)
  - 2XL: 32px+ (hero text)
- Consistent weights: 500 (medium), 600 (semibold), 700 (bold)

#### Layout
- **Visual hierarchy**: Clear progression from title â†’ emoji â†’ action â†’ results âœ“

- **Icon + text pairing**: Used thoughtfully (camera icon + "Take Photo")

#### Advanced Features
- **Animations**: Spring animations on button press (~150ms) âœ“
- **Motion**: Fade-in on mount, scale on score display âœ“
- **All animations < 200ms**: âœ“
- **Shadows**: Subtle elevation with shadowOpacity: 0.1 âœ“
- **High-res ready**: Vector icons, scalable components âœ“

**Design Quality Score**: Professional, following iOS Human Interface Guidelines
